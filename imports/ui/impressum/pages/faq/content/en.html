                Why not learn with paper index cards?

                The digital maps lack the haptics of paper, but they have indisputable advantages.
                Advantages:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    They are as portable and mobile as your smartphone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are multimedia: you can insert pictures, podcasts and videos as you like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They represent the most complicated mathematical formulas in LaTeX cleanly.

                    The knowledge from all the modules of your studies is in one place and you can do it in
                    one place.
                    at any time with one click.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are automatically returned to you at the right time for learning.
                    push messages
                    on your phone remind you of learning.
                </li>

                What does it mean when a set of cards refers to an <b>&raquo;active learning phase"?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here the teacher has activated the <b>bonus option</b>.
                If you're using the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernkartei" target="_blank">fivefold
                method,
                of Sebastian Leitner's</a> cards regularly, you can earn bonus points,
                creditable to the examination grade.
                That depends on your teacher, of course.
                In this case, you will be sent a <b>message</b> to your mobile phone (if you have previously
                used üçÖcards in the
                browser
                on your smartphone) and/or by <b>e-mail</b> to your study workload.
                is indicated.
                You will only receive the bonus if, at the end of the active learning phase, all cards in
                the last
                compartment
                &raquo;Learned&laquo;, see the button &raquo;My level according to Leitner&laquo;.

                Why should one day learn cards be repeated at ever longer intervals?
            </p>
            <p>
                A detailed explanation as to why <b>repetitions of the lessons learnt</b> in longer periods
                of time are necessary.
                Intervals are so important, you will find in our paper with scientific evidence,
                see
                on the <a href="{{pathFor route='about'}}">üçÖcards</a> page.
                But Daniel Hunold explains this faster and cooler in the video:

                How can I pass on sets of cards to my fellow students?
            </p>
            <p>
                Either you publish the sets of cards in the &raquo;Pool&laquo; of üçÖcards in the category
                &raquo;Free&laquo;.
                or
                you export the individual deck as a file.

                I have seen that there is also the type of <b>card &raquo;Mitschrift&laquo;</b>. How can I
                get a
                Write your lecture with üçÖcards?
            </p>
            <p>
                As a digitally affine person, as a &raquo;digital native&laquo;, you could take notes with
                your laptop
                or computer.
                Write tablet.
                But handwriting with colours and pictures is better, as Daniel Hunold explains in the video.
                After the lecture, take a picture of your transcript and upload it to your dropbox or your
                computer.
                in
                the cloud of Google &amp; Co. You can put the photo on a &raquo;transcript&laquo; type card.
                by
                Insert link.
                The back of the page is used for post-processing the lecture.

                install
                and customize (as <b>&raquo;My Cards&laquo;</b>) and offline with the locally held decks of
                cards
                to learn?

        üçÖcards is not a traditional flashcard app like <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank">Quizlet</a>
        or
        <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/" target="_blank">SuperMemo</a>.
        üçÖcards not only supports learning with digital flashcards, but also the
        notes
        in lectures and a bonus award for continuous writing and learning.
        üçÖcards sees itself as a <b>learning platform that accompanies the lectures</b>, as a virtual
        place,
        where learning time with cognitive activities (co-writing, post-editing of transcriptions, learning
        cards
        repetitive answering of learning questions) is spent intensively.
        Unlike Moodle, which is mostly used as a distribution platform for scripts.

            Academic Procrastination: Pedagogical Apps to Implement Distributed Learning in Course
            Design</a>
    </p>

        Abstract: Most of the facts and figures, terms and concepts taught in college are learned in the
        week
        before examination and forgotten a month after. Although we have known about the very low long-term
        knowledge retention of cramming since Ebbinghaus‚Äô &raquo;forgetting curve&laquo; in 1885, this
        learning tactic
        prevails because it works‚Äîat least for passing exams. As university lecturers, we seldom received a
        training on effective teaching and learning strategies. However, we can follow the evidence-based
        recommendations from cognitive and educational psychology on how to structure a course to distribute
        learning. With new pedagogical apps at hand, we can implement <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>
        against
        procrastination in our course design. This paper outlines a pedagogical project to be conducted
        across
        several consecutive semesters. The project follows the &raquo;What Works Clearinghouse&laquo;
        practice guide on
        spacing learning events over time. The recommendations are implemented by using <a
            href="https://arsnova.eu" target="_blank">ARSnova</a>, a set of innovative web-based
        question-and-answer apps for quizzing in class and self-quizzing at home.

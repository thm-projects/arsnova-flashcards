        The first two methods are the most effective in the sense of long-term memory, see the
        scientific studies, cited in our <a rel="noopener noreferrer"   href="{{pathFor route='about'}}">Paper</a>.
        The methods are based on the <strong> principle of distributed learning</strong> , i. e. learning in several
        ways
        Time periods.
        In contrast, bulimia learning, which is widespread among students but is ineffective, only takes
        place once a year.

        of the week before the exam.

        <strong> Leitner's 5-subject learning method</strong>  places cards that have already been learned in certain
        longer periods of time.
        expect
        distances for repeated learning.
        Cards that are not remembered will be placed in the first compartment.
        In this way, difficult flashcards are repeated more often than simple flashcards.
        The intervals between subjects are usually: daily (1?2) and weekly (2?3),
        once a month
        (3?4) and quarterly (4?5) - compare with the forgetting curves in this <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="{{pathFor route='about'}}">picture</a>.
        Cards in the last compartment are regarded as permanently learned. The maximum daily number of cards
        to learn
        is given by the teacher.
